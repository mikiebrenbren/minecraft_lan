#Minecraft setup for lan

NOTE: Most changes will be made to the start.sh file

Currently I have the shell script starting the server opening the application 
editing the launcher_profile.json file, killing the application and starting it again.

The reason I kill and start again because, if this is the first time launching the app
the edit of the launcher_profile does not stick for some reason and I am forced to kill app
and restart again for the change to show up on the app.  There may be a better way 
but this is how I am doing this for now.  Makes it easier for when I finally cave after my daughters
request to play Multiplayer minecraft.  Enjoy.
